## What is Open Payments?

Open Payments is an open API standard that can be implemented by account servicing entities (e.g. banks, digital wallet providers, and mobile money providers) to facilitate interoperability in the setup and completion of payments for different use cases including:

- [Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org)
- Tipping/Donations (low value/low friction)
- eCommerce checkout
- P2P transfers
- Subscriptions
- Invoice Payments

An Open Payments server runs two sub-systems, a **resource server** which exposes APIs for performing functions against the
underlying accounts and and **authorisation server** which exposes APIs compliant with the
[GNAP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol) standard for getting grants to access the resource server
APIs.

This repository hosts the Open API Specifications of the two APIs which are published along with additional documentation at
https://openpayments.guide.

Additionally, this repository also contains three published libraries:

- [`@interledger/open-payments`](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments/tree/main/packages/open-payments) contains a NodeJS Open Payments SDK to make requests via the Open Payments API, as well as TypeScript types for the API.
- [`@interledger/http-signature-utils`](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments/tree/main/packages/http-signature-utils) provides tools for working with [HTTP Message Signatures](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures).
- [`@interledger/openapi`](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments/tree/main/packages/openapi) exposes functionality to validate requests and responses according to a given OpenAPI 3.1 schema.

The code for the landing [page](https://openpayments.guide) is in `./docs`.
