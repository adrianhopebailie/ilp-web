After a quote is accepted and the authorized client obtains the requisite grant from the payer’s authorization server, the client can create an outgoing payment resource against the payer’s wallet address.

These code snippets create an outgoing payment to a given wallet address. The amount of the outgoing payment is based on the amounts in the associated quote.
