An authorization server will place a grant request into a pending state if the server requires additional communication from the client to facilitate interaction. When interaction is complete, the authorization server responds to the client with an interaction reference.

The client must include the reference (as the `interact_ref`) in a grant continuation request to indicate the grant request should be moved from pending to processing for reevaluation by the auth server.

These code snippets enable an authorized client to issue a grant continuation request to the authorization server after a completed interaction.
