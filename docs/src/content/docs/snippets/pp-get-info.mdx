For a client to request a grant from an authorization server, the client must verify the validity of a payment pointer and get the auth server’s URL.

These code snippets enable an authenticated or unauthenticated client to verify a payment pointer, get the basic information required to construct a new transaction, and discover the auth server’s URL.
