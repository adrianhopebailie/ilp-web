Open Payments supports the payment methods listed below. The payment method determines how funds are moved out of one OP-enabled wallet account and into another.

## Supported payment methods

### Interledger Protocol (ILP)

ILP is an open protocol suite for transferring packets of value between peers and across different payment networks or ledgers. The open architecture and minimal protocol enable interoperability for any value transfer system and is optimized for routing large volumes of low-value packets.

Review the <LinkOut href='https://interledger.org/developers/get-started/'>ILP developer documentation</LinkOut> for more information.
