title: Make recurring payments
---

import { CodeBlock, LinkOut } from '@interledger/docs-design-system'

The Open Payments (OP) API facilitates multiple uses cases for payments to and from different OP-enabled wallets. In this guide we look at the steps for making recurring payments.

An example use case for making recurring payments may be a Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) scheme where a payer purchases a high priced item but pays for it in installments over regularly scheduled intervals.

### Prerequisites

- TypeScript
- NPM

### Dependencies

## Steps

### 1. Import dependencies

Import `createAuthenticatedClient` from the Open Payments SDK package.

```ts
import { createAuthenticatedClient } from '@interledger/open-payments'
```

### 2. Create an authenticated Open Payments client

Create an OP authenticated client by providing the following parameters:

- `walletAddressURL` is your OP-enabled wallet address that your client will use to authenticate itself to one or more Authorization Servers (AS).
- `privateKey` is the EdDSA-Ed25519 key or preferably the absolute or relative file path to the key that is bound to your wallet address. A public key signed with this private
  key must be made available as a public JWK docuement at `{walletAddressUrl}/jwks.json` url.
- `keyId` is the identifier of the private key and the corresponding public key.

<CodeBlock title="Example">
```ts
const client = await createAuthenticatedClient({
  walletAddressUrl: WALLET_ADDRESS,
  privateKey: PRIVATE_KEY_PATH,
  keyId: KEY_ID,
});

````
</CodeBlock>


### 3. Get the walletAddresses of payee and payer

Fetch the ``walletAddress`` of the wallet you want to send a payment to and the ``walletAddress`` of the wallet you want to send the payment from.

<CodeBlock title="Example">

```ts
const payeeWalletAddress = await client.walletAddress.get({
  url: 'https://bank_of_payee/payee'
})
const payerWalletAddress = await client.walletAddress.get({
  url: 'https://bank_of_payer/payer'
})

````

</CodeBlock>

### 4. Request an Incoming Payment grant

Request an `incomingPayment` grant from the payee wallet's AS

<CodeBlock title="Example">

```ts
const incomingPaymentGrant = await client.grant.request(
  { url: payeeWalletAddress.authServer },
  {
    access_token: {
      access: [
        {
          type: 'incoming-payment',
          actions: ['read-all', 'create']
        }
      ]
    }
  }
)
```

</CodeBlock>

### 5. Create an Incoming Payment

Create an `incomingPayment` on the payee wallet's Resource Server (RS) using the access token returned by the AS in the grant request.

<CodeBlock title="Example">
```ts
const incomingPayment = await client.incomingPayment.create(
  {
    walletAddress: payeeWalletAddress.id,
    accessToken: incomingPaymentGrant.access_token.value
  },
  {
    incomingAmount: {
      assetCode: 'USD',
      assetScale: 2,
      value: '10000'
    },
    metadata: {
      externalRef: '#An-example-invoice-number',
      description: 'One-time payment example'
    }
  }
)
```
</CodeBlock>

### 6. Request a Quote grant

Request a `quote` grant from the payer wallet's AS.

<CodeBlock title="Example">
```ts
const quoteGrant = await client.grant.request(
  { url: payerWalletAddress.authServer },
  {
    access_token: {
      access: [
        {
          type: 'quote',
          actions: ['create', 'read']
        }
      ]
    }
  }
)
```
</CodeBlock>

### 7. Create a Quote

Create a `quote` on the payer wallet's RS using the access token returned by the AS in the grant request.

<CodeBlock title="Example">
```ts
const quote = await client.quote.create(
  {
    walletAddress: payerWalletAddress.id,
    accessToken: quoteGrant.access_token.value
  },
  { receiver: incomingPayment.id }
)
```
</CodeBlock>

### 8. Request an Outgoing Payment grant

Request an `outgoingPayment` grant from the payer wallet's AS with the additional parameters:

1. Add the `limits` object to your [grant request](/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request/#request-body)
2. Specify the `interval` property with an interval period conforming to the <LinkOut href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Repeating_intervals">ISO8601 repeating interval string format.</LinkOut>

**Note:** This request requires an interactive grant as the payer will need to consent before an `outgoingPayment` is made against their wallet.

For details on how to facilitate an interactive grant please see the <LinkOut href='https://openpayments.guide/guides/create-interactive-grant/'>
Create an Interactive Grant guide. </LinkOut>

<CodeBlock title="Example">
```ts
const grant = await client.grant.request(
    {
        url: payerWalletAddress.authServer,
    },
    {
        access_token: {
            access: [
                {
                    identifier: walletAddress.id,
                    type: "outgoing-payment",
                    actions: ["list", "list-all", "read", "read-all", "create"],
                    limits: {
                        debitAmount: DEBIT_AMOUNT,
                        receiveAmount: RECEIVE_AMOUNT,
                        interval: "R12/2019-08-24T14:15:22Z/P1M"
                    },
                },
            ],
        },
        interact: {
            start: ["redirect"],
            finish: {
                method: "redirect",
                uri: "http://localhost:3344",
                nonce: NONCE,
            },
        },
    },
);
```
</CodeBlock>

### 9. Create an initial Outgoing Payment

Create an `outgoingPayment` on the payer wallet's RS using the access token returned by the AS in the grant request.

<CodeBlock title="Example">
```ts
const outgoingPayment = await client.outgoingPayment.create(
  {
    walletAddress: payerWalletAddress.id,
    accessToken: outgoingPaymentGrant.access_token.value
  },
  { quoteId: quote.id, description: 'Your payment to the payee has been made' }
)
```
</CodeBlock>

### 10. Rotate the Access Token

Rotate the access token obtained from the previous `outgoingPayment` grant request.

<CodeBlock title="Example">
```ts
const token = await client.token.rotate({
    url: MANAGE_URL,
    accessToken: ACCESS_TOKEN,
});
```
</CodeBlock>

### 11. Create another Outgoing Payment

Create another `outgoingPayment` on the payer wallet's RS using the new access token returned by the AS in the previous step.

<CodeBlock title="Example">
```ts
const outgoingPayment = await client.outgoingPayment.create(
  {
    walletAddress: payerWalletAddress.id,
    accessToken: outgoingPaymentGrant.access_token.value
  },
  { quoteId: quote.id, description: 'Your payment to the payee has been made' }
)
```
</CodeBlock>

### 12. Make recurring Outgoing Payments

Repeat steps 10 and 11 to facilitate as many payments as needed by your application.
