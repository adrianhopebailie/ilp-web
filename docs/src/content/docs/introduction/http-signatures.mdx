title: HTTP message signatures

import { CodeBlock, LinkOut } from '@interledger/docs-design-system'

HTTP message signatures are cryptographic digital signatures used by the Open Payments API to secure the HTTP messages transferred between sender, receiver, and third-party initiating payment systems.

The creation and verification of these digital signatures enables an authorization server to control access to protected resources in the process of orchestrating transactions.

## Purpose

When exchanging HTTP messages, Open Payments-enabled systems verify the following aspects of message security:

- **Authenticity** of the system requesting permissions to access specific resources.
- **Integrity** of some or all of the message fields to guard against the risk of message tampering.

## Understanding HTTP signatures

### Specification

The Open Payments API adheres to the <LinkOut href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures/'>HTTP Message Signature specification</LinkOut> which has been drafted by the HTTP Workgroup of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

### Signature algorithms

Various digital signature algorithms can be used to generate HTTP message signatures. The Open Payments API implements the **Ed25519** variant of the EdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm), an elliptic curve cryptographic algorithm that offers advantages over earlier generations of public key cryptography algorithms.

The benefits of using Ed25519 include:

- Relatively efficient security offered with smaller key sizes. Earlier generation public-key cryptographic algorithms, such as RSA, offer comparable security with notably larger key sizes.
- Good hash function collision resilience.
- Speed and efficiency for signature generation and verification.
- Guarding against the risk of an encryption key downgrade attack.

For more information about the EdDSA and its variants, refer to <LinkOut href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8032'>RFC8032</LinkOut>.
