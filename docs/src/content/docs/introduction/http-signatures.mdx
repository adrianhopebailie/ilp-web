HTTP message signatures are cryptographic digital signatures used by the Open Payments API to secure the HTTP messages transferred between sender, receiver, and third-party initiating payment systems.

The creation and verification of these digital signatures enables an authorization server to control access to protected resources in the process of orchestrating transactions.

## Purpose

When exchanging HTTP messages, Open Payments-enabled systems verify the following aspects of message security:

- **Authenticity** of the system requesting permissions to access specific resources.
- **Integrity** of some or all of the message fields to guard against the risk of message tampering.

## Understanding HTTP signatures

### Specification

The Open Payments API adheres to the <LinkOut href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures/'>HTTP Message Signature specification</LinkOut> which has been drafted by the HTTP Workgroup of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

### Signature algorithms

Various digital signature algorithms can be used to generate HTTP message signatures. The Open Payments API implements the **Ed25519** variant of the EdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm), an elliptic curve cryptographic algorithm that offers advantages over earlier generations of public key cryptography algorithms.

The benefits of using Ed25519 include:

- Relatively efficient security offered with smaller key sizes. Earlier generation public-key cryptographic algorithms, such as RSA, offer comparable security with notably larger key sizes.
- Good hash function collision resilience.
- Speed and efficiency for signature generation and verification.
- Guarding against the risk of an encryption key downgrade attack.

For more information about the EdDSA and its variants, refer to <LinkOut href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8032'>RFC8032</LinkOut>.

### Message signature creation

The [RFC8032](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8032) specification permits the use of different components of an HTTP message to generate a uniquely labelled message signature. There can be multiple signatures within each HTTP message, each one generated using a different signature algorithm.

The Open Payments API implements the specification to create a signature, starting with the original HTTP message (note: for simplicity, this illustration uses HTTP 1.1):

![An HTTP message, before signature](/img/http-sig/1-original_msg.png)

Select the fields of the message header to use to create the signature. 
Also specify the other signature parameters, the signing algorithm, and the public key identifier:

![The message components & other signature parameters](/img/http-sig/2-select_rest_of_sig_params.png)

The signature base then gets created, with its final sub-field being an ordered list of the signature parameters, in structured HTTP format: 

![The signature base](/img/http-sig/3-sig_base.png)

Bringing the signature creation process together:

The output is a signed HTTP message with a header that includes the labelled signature value, along with its associated signature input field:
