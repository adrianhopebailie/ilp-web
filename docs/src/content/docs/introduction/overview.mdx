Handling payments is a crucial part of many online applications. Whether it's an eCommerce site selling products, a fundraising platform accepting donations, a streaming service charging for content, or a subscription service with monthly fees, digital payments are central to their operations. Many application developers rely on third-party payment gateways to handle these transactions, which can introduce additional expenses and limit control over the user experience.

Open Payments is an open RESTful API and an API standard that enables clients to interface with Open Payments-enabled accounts. In this context, a client is an application, such as a mobile or web app, that consumes one or more Open Payments resources, typically requiring access privileges from one or several authorization servers.

The Open Payments standard is meant to be implemented by account servicing entities (ASEs). ASEs provide and maintain payment accounts for payers and payees, and are regulated entities within the countries they operate. Examples of ASEs include banks, digital wallet providers, and mobile money providers.

## Benefits of Open Payments

When an ASE implements Open Payments, their customers’ financial accounts become Open Payments-enabled. Clients can then call the Open Payments APIs to view an Open Payments-enabled account’s transaction history and certain account details, as well as issue instructions for receiving payments into and sending payments from the account.

For example, an application developer can build payments functionality into their app without the need for custom integrations with each ASE. Users with Open Payments-enabled accounts can use the app to send funds to another Open Payments-enabled account, regardless of whether the recipient uses the same ASE. This app should be able to connect to any ASE that implements the Open Payments standard without the need for custom integrations.

The Open Payments standard simplifies integration by offering a single access point to various financial accounts, whether they are bank accounts, digital wallets, or mobile money accounts. This approach eliminates the need for multiple custom integrations, similar to how email standards facilitate seamless communication across different email providers.

Refer to the [Open Payments concepts](/introduction/op-concepts) and [Open Payments flow](/introduction/op-flow) pages for additional details.

## User control and security

With Open Payments, users remain in full control of their financial transactions. When an application uses Open Payments, it securely and cryptographically shares important information about itself with the financial instituion it interacts with. This verification ensures that the account provider knows the application is legitimate when making a payment request on your behalf. Importantly, any withdrawal of money from your account requires your explicit consent, giving you granular control over permissions and transaction limits.

## Payments

Open Payments does not execute payments or touch funds in any way. Instead, the APIs allow clients to issue payment instructions to ASEs.

For example, a client can instruct an ASE to send a payment of $20.00 USD from its customer’s account to another Open Payments-enabled account at a different ASE. The sending ASE is responsible for executing and settling the payment with the receiving ASE outside of Open Payments. The ability to execute payments between Open Payments-enabled ASEs is predicated on the availability of a common payment rail between the ASEs.

By separating payment instructions from execution/settlement, client developers can include payment functionality within their feature sets without, for example, also registering as a licensed money transfer business.

## Open Payments account identification

Every Open Payments-enabled account is identified by one or more URLs. These URLs not only identify the account, but are also Open Payments service endpoints that provide the entry point for the API. These URLs are called [wallet addresses](/introduction/wallet-addresses).

Wallet addresses in Open Payments are designed to be user-friendly and publicly shareable. They function like email addresses, allowing for straightforward and secure interactions with accounts across various financial institutions without exposing sensitive data.

## Grant negotiation and authorization

Clients must receive grants before issuing payment instructions. Grants give clients the authorization, via access tokens, to perform one or more operations. Grants represent the rights that are given to the client, such as the right to create an incoming payment request.

Open Payments leverages the <LinkOut href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol'>Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol (GNAP)</LinkOut> to define a standard mechanism for clients to request and receive the grants necessary to use the Open Payments APIs. All requests require signatures, which protect the integrity of the requests. Signatures are generated according to the <LinkOut href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures/'>HTTP Signatures specification</LinkOut>.

GNAP allows account holders to have specific and fine-grained control over the permissions they grant to the clients that connect to their accounts, including control over the amounts of transactions with time-based and velocity-based limits. This enables powerful use cases such as third-party payment initiation and delegated authorization without compromising the security of the underlying financial accounts and payment instruments.

Review the [Grant negotiation and authorization](/introduction/grants) page for more information.

## Relation to Open Banking

Open Payments aims to improve upon existing Open Banking standards as defined in the UK, EU, and other jurisdictions.

Existing Open Banking ecosystems are dominated by aggregators and intermediaries, making it impossible for independent third-parties, such as small merchants, to use payment initiation APIs directly against their customers’ payment accounts. Open Payments allows for scenarios where clients can dynamically register and engage with the APIs without needing to pre-register with the ASE. This allows for a truly distributed and federated payment ecosystem with global reach and no dependence on any particular underlying account type or settlement system.

Open Payments is also a significantly simpler standard with a small number of resource types and a more secure and powerful authorization protocol.

## Goals

The goal of Open Payments is to define a standard that's adopted by all ASEs. The standard doesn't rely on any singular payment method, currency, or programming language, encouraging interoperability between ASEs and other parties.

When an ASE adopts the Open Payments standard, clients (applications and other parties) will know how to interact with the ASE and can integrate payments directly into their products without requiring:

- End-users to create a new payment account for every application and/or website they use
- Developers to build clients in any one programming language
- ASEs and clients to create and deploy custom integrations to communicate with one another

Open Payments aims to simplify and democratize payments by providing a standardized, easy-to-integrate solution. This reduces development effort and enhances financial inclusion by making payment solutions more affordable and accessible to all.

## Use cases

Open Payments facilitates various use cases including but not limited to:

### Peer-to-peer payment transfers

As mentioned above, a sender with an account at one Open Payments-enabled ASE can send a payment to a recipient with an account at a different Open Payments-enabled ASE by sending the payment from the sender’s wallet address to the recipient’s wallet address. Thus, Open Payments brings a similar user experience to payments as email brings to person-to-person communications.

### E-commerce platforms

Open Payments can facilitate one-time payments directly between merchants and customers or via third-party marketplaces. A key difference between conventional e-commerce platforms and those enabled by Open Payments is that the payment function won’t be in the control of a sole payment processor or gateway. Refer to the [one-time payment guide](/guides/make-onetime-payment) for more details.

### Recurring payments

In addition to one-time payments that are common on e-commerce marketplaces, Open Payments can also be used to enable subscriptions or payments made at recurring intervals, such as those that are used for Buy Now and Pay Later (BNPL) plans. Refer to the [recurring payment guide](/guides/make-recurring-payments) for more details.

### Web Monetization

Web Monetization is a new and open API standard for website visitors to pay website owners and content creators directly from the browser to the website. As Open Payments is integrated with Web Monetization, website visitors can access content and support creators without going through a paywall. Website owners and content creators can receive payments without depending on any particular payment processor.
