This page describes the Open Payments flows at a high level. The sequence diagrams are for illustrative purposes and might not be an exact representation of a given flow.

## Get account details

A client can retrieve public details about an Open Payments-enabled account by issuing a <LinkOut href='/apis/wallet-address-server/operations/get-wallet-address/'>GET request</LinkOut> to the account's wallet address. Details include the asset code and scale of the underlying account and the authorization server endpoint to call for grant requests.

<MermaidWrapper client:load>

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant WA as Wallet address

    C->>WA: GET wallet address url (e.g. https://wallet.example.com/alice)
    WA->>C: 200 wallet address found, return public account details

`}
/>

</MermaidWrapper>

## Basic payment flow

### Assumptions

- The client's end-user is the payer.
- The client already has the payer's OP-enabled account details and is able to send payments on behalf of the payer.
- The client has issued a GET request to the payee's wallet address and received the authorization server and resource server URLs.

### Incoming payment

The client first <LinkOut href='/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request'>requests/receives a grant</LinkOut> from the payee's authorization server to create an `incoming-payment` resource. The client then sends a request to the payee-side resource server to <LinkOut href='/apis/resource-server/operations/create-incoming-payment/'>create the resource</LinkOut>. When created, the resource server returns unique payment details the client will use to address one or more payments to the payee.

<MermaidWrapper client:load>

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client instance
    participant AS as Payee-side<br/>authorization server
    participant RS as Payee-side<br/>resource server

    C->>AS: Grant request (POST) with type=incoming-payment
    AS->>C: 200 OK, returns access token
    C->>RS: Create incoming payment resource (POST)
    RS->>C: 201 Incoming payment resource created

`}
/>

</MermaidWrapper>

### Quote

The client <LinkOut href='/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request'>requests/receives a grant</LinkOut> from the end-user's authorization server to create a `quote` resource. The client then sends a request to the end-user's resource server to <LinkOut href='/apis/resource-server/operations/create-quote'>create the resource</LinkOut>. When created, the resource server returns, among other things, a quote `id` and the amount it will cost to make the payment.

<MermaidWrapper client:load>

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client instance
    participant AS as Payer-side<br/>authorization server
    participant RS as Payer-side<br/>resource server

    C->>AS: Grant request (POST) with type=quote
    AS->>C: 200 OK, returns access token
    C->>RS: Create quote resource (POST)
    RS->>C: 201 Quote resource created

`}
/>

</MermaidWrapper>

### Outgoing payment

Before an outgoing payment resource can be created on the end-user's account, Open Payments requires the client to send an <LinkOut href='/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request'>interactive grant request</LinkOut> to the authorization server.

An interactive grant requires explicit consent be collected from the end-user before an access token is issued. While the client must facilitate the interaction, the end-user's authorization server and identity provider are responsible for the interface and collecting consent.

After consent is obtained, the client requests permission to <LinkOut href='/apis/auth-server/operations/post-continue'>continue the grant request</LinkOut> in order to obtain an access token.

<Interactive />

Once an access token is acquired, the client can request the creation of the <LinkOut href='/apis/resource-server/operations/create-outgoing-payment'>outgoing-payment resource</LinkOut>. The setup of the payment is complete and the Open Payments flow ends after the resource is created.

<MermaidWrapper client:load>

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram

    participant C as Client instance
    participant RS as Payer-side<br/>resource server

    C->>RS: Create outgoing payment resource (POST)
    RS->>C: 201 Outgoing payment resource created

`}
/>

</MermaidWrapper>

## Get transaction history

To provide an end-user with their transaction history, the client can retrieve a list of the user's <LinkOut href='/apis/resource-server/operations/list-incoming-payments/'>incoming (received) payments</LinkOut> and <LinkOut href='/apis/resource-server/operations/list-outgoing-payments/'>outgoing (sent) payments</LinkOut>.

<MermaidWrapper client:load>

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram

    participant C as Client
    participant RS as Resource server

    C->>RS: Get list of incoming/outgoing payments <br/>with wallet-address={url of wallet address}
    RS->>C: 200 OK

`}
/>

</MermaidWrapper>

Similarly, the client can provide the end-user with details about a specific <LinkOut href='/apis/resource-server/operations/get-incoming-payment'>incoming</LinkOut> or <LinkOut href='/apis/resource-server/operations/get-outgoing-payment'>outgoing</LinkOut> payment.

<MermaidWrapper client:load>

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram

    participant C as Client
    participant RS as Resource server

    C->>RS: Get incoming/outgoing payment with <br/>id={url identifying incoming/outgoing payment}
    RS->>C: 200 Payment found

`}
/>

</MermaidWrapper>
