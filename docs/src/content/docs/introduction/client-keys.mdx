All client requests in Open Payments are signed using a unique key that identifies the client to the authorization and resource servers. All requests, except for new grant requests, also carry an access token that is bound to the key.

## Key registry

A key registry is a list of keys, generated and stored by the client, for when the client requires access to protected Open Payment resources. Since grant requests are completed over multiple signed HTTP requests, it's important for the client to provide a way to consistently identify itself across these requests to the authorization server. The key registry allows the authorization server to verify that the client is who it says it is.

Each client is represented by a [wallet address](/introduction/wallet-addresses). A client's key registry is publicly accessible through its wallet address via a `jwks.json` endpoint. An authorization server can retrieve the client's key registry by accessing `WALLET_ADDRESS/jwks.json`.

<CodeBlock title='Example'>
  ``` https://wallet.example.com/alice/jwks.json ```
</CodeBlock>

### Registry structure

The key registry must expose public keys in the form of JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS). The keys must be generated using the `Ed25519` algorithm and the resultant JWKS document must contain the following fields and values.

```
{
  alg: 'EdDSA',
  kty: 'OKP',
  crv: 'Ed25519'
}
```

Additionally, it must contain the `x` and `kid` (key ID) fields for the specific client to identify itself in a signature.

<CodeBlock title="Example: https://wallet.example.com/alice/jwks.json">
```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kid": "3724c845-829d-425a-9a0d-194d6f12c336",
      "x": "_Eg6UcC8G-O4TY2cxGnZyG_lMn0aWF1rVV-Bqn9NmhE",
      "alg": "EdDSA",
      "kty": "OKP",
      "crv": "Ed25519"
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeBlock>

### Key generation

Before a client can request a grant for the first time, it must:

1. Generate an asymmetric key pair. Keys must be generated using the <LinkOut href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8032'>ed25519 algorithm</LinkOut>.
   :::note
   A `keyId` must be generated to identify the pair; however, this is usually the responsibility of the account servicing entity (ASE).
   :::
2. Add the public key to its key registry.
3. Store the private key. The private key is used to sign the payload described in the [key proofing method](#key-proofing-method) section below.

## Client requests

Since client requests are completed over multiple signed HTTP requests, it's important for a client to provide a way to consistently identify itself across these requests. As such, clients must include the following when making requests:

- Headers
  - A `Signature-Input` header that includes the `keyId` associated with the client's key pair. This header is a comma-separated list of headers that map to values in the data that was signed.
  - A `signature` header generated based on the `Signature-Input`, using the `EdDSA` signing algorithm
- Body
  - A `client` property containing the client’s wallet address

Securing client requests follows a profile of what's defined in the <LinkOut href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol#name-securing-requests-from-the-'>GNAP specification</LinkOut>.

:::note
Open Payments **does not** support bearer tokens.

### Grant requests

Upon receiving a signed grant request, the authorization server obtains the client’s domain from the `client` property. The authorization server binds the domain to the grant in order to use the domain to acquire the key set for subsequent grant requests.

The authorization server then acquires the client's key registry by making a `GET` request to the client’s JWKS endpoint at `WALLET_ADDRESS/jwks.json`. When the authorization server locates the public key containing the `keyId` included in the request's `Signature-Input` header, the authorization server uses the key to decrypt and validate the request's signature. This binds the client to the grant and allows the authorization server to continue with the grant request.

## Key proofing method

### HTTP message signatures

Open Payments uses the <LinkOut href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol#name-http-message-signatures'>HTTP message signatures</LinkOut> (`httpsig`) key proofing method.

The `httpsig` proofing method must be declared as part of the key material when directly using a key to request a grant. The key material below is for illustrative purposes. In Open Payments, it's expected that the wallet address be used in the grant request.

<CodeBlock title="Example">

```json
"key": {
    "proof": "httpsig",
    "jwk": {
        "kid": "3724c845-829d-425a-9a0d-194d6f12c336",
        "x": "_Eg6UcC8G-O4TY2cxGnZyG_lMn0aWF1rVV-Bqn9NmhE",
        "alg": "EdDSA",
        "kty": "OKP",
        "crv": "Ed25519"
    }
}
```

</CodeBlock>

When using `httpsig`, the signer (the client) creates an HTTP message signature. Open Payments clients typically secure their requests to servers by presenting an access token and proof of a key it possesses. The exception is for calls to an authorization server to initiate a grant. In this case, a key proof is used with no access token and is a non-authorized signed request.

See the [HTTP message signatures](/introduction/http-signatures) page for more information specific to Open Payments. Additional information is found in the <LinkOut href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9421'>specification</LinkOut> for HTTP message signatures.
