An identity provider (IdP) is a system or service that manages user authentication, identity information, and consent. Open Payments requires any authorization server (AS) that issues <Tooltip content="A grant requiring explicit interaction/consent from the resource owner before an access token can be issued" client:load><span>interactive grants</span></Tooltip> be integrated with an IdP.

After an interactive grant request is initiated and the AS sets the session, the AS provides the client with the IdP URI to redirect the end-user to.
